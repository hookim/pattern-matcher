### What is "pattern matcher"?
+ it compares 2 files. the first one be the main. the second be the auxilary.
+ it browses through the main files and finds **the longest identical** sentences which are present in the auxilary file as well
+ it doesn't consider the edited case one. it treats them as multiple different sentences. (ex3)
+ it analyzes files on the token level. 
  a token can be a string consists of digits or alphabets, a special character. a white space can't be a token. so it just skips.(ex4)
